This is a companion site to *Cybersecurity Considerations for Heavy Vehicle Event Data Recorders* by Dr. Jeremy Daily, UTulsa and Ben Gardiner, Irdeto.

There are a few useful companion files on this site, namely:
* [the working copy of the attack tree, a mindmup JSON file](Security_in_HD_Forensics.mup)
* [an interactive html+javscript complete attack tree](Security_in_HD_Forensics_Interactive_Tree.html)
* [a generated attack tree report](Security_in_HD_Forensics_TARA_Report.html)
* [an archive of the DDEC records and example tampering discussed in the esCAR presentation](DDEC_Example.zip)
* [a preprint of the paper](Security_in_HD_Forensics.pdf)

The interactive attack tree and report will only render correctly if viewed through the [github-pages view](https://Heavy-Vehicle-Networking-At-U-Tulsa.github.io/CybersecurityForHVDERs/)
