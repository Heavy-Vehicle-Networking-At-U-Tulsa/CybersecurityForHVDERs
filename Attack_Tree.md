### Attack Tree

This is an interactive rendering on the entire attack tree; all likehoods are rendered as color-coded edges in the graph, both collapsed nodes and reference nodes are clickable to expand the subtree or jump to the referent subtree, respectively. The `a` key will expand the entire tree.
