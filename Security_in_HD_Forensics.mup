          "content": "<div>Attributing a digital record to a crash event requires at least a date, distance, or time record to corroborate the event. Some ECUs contain real-time clocks (RTC) that keep track of the calendar date and 24 hour time. These systems require a battery backup, usually in the form of a coin cell lithium battery. Time is tracked as the number of seconds from an epoch. ECUs rarely keep accurate time and are subject to drift. It is critical to capture the clock drift at the time of the forensic investigation, by comparing the ECU time to a known reference clock, like network time protocol, or GPS. Mileage is the odometer reading, however, some ECUs keep track of distance using different memory elements. One could track the high resolution vehicle distance of 5 meters per bit (J1939 SPN 917), whereas another record keeps track of distance in 0.125 km/bit increments (J1939 SPN 245). The hours of ECU runtime is also used to tie recorded events to a crash. If the amount of time an ECU runs after an event is attributable through a forensic process, then the event can be attributed. For example, if a ECU runtime is a few seconds ahead of the event, then its is event was likely from the crash that just took place. Only one of these are attribution points are needed to tie the event to the crash; therefore all of these (3.1-3.3) must be eliminated to be a successful attack.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Identifiers include engine serial number and vehicle identfier. These are important to tie the record to the vehicle. Often a photograph of the crash scene and a VIN inspection provides the necessary evidence. It is important to note that some ECUs allow the end user to customize the VIN, so the digital record may not match the chassis VIN. Engine replacements and glider kits also exist in heavy vehicles, which makes documenting the engine in the truck important.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The context for the crash deals with understanding the relationship between the investigation and the event in question. If the truck is driven since the event was set, the context of the crash may be important. This most often happens when someone examines only an HVEDR record without any other input information regarding the case.</div><div><br></div><div>SUBTREE::</div>",

Correlating timestamps from an HVEDR to external timestamps often requires an adjustment. The HVEDR time stamp can be subtracted from the reference time stamp to create a delta at the time of the investigation. This delta is then added back to the event trigger time to place the HVEDR record into the actual time. This adjusted time is often compared to first-responder records to establish attribution. To ensure the adjusted time is correct, both the ECU time and the external reference time must be genuine.<br></div><div><br></div>SUBTREE::",

          "content": "<div><div>HVEDR data that is not representative of an event can be misleading and violate the notion of trust necessary for the courts. The following examples demonstrate how these attacks on the digital data can manifest.</div><div><br></div><div>Incorrect recordings deal with the notion that an ECU can incorrectly translate sensor data into engineering units. Sometimes this can be from a configuration change, like gearing or tire size, that would skew the data based on an incorrect calibration. A more deliberate alteration would be to use a device like a GPS jammer, or a vehicle speed sensor adjuster to change the data being recorded by the ECU. Most, if not all, fielded HVEDRs systems faithfully report the information it receives without question. Thus, sensor inputs are considered trustworthy by the EDR. Tampering with or compromising with sensor inputs will affect data before the event, and may be apparent in other operational data. For example, GPS speeds coul deviate from vehicle speed if the VSS signal is compromised. Wear and wiring issues may also compromise sensor input.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes the data recorded in the ECU and the translation of the binary data to engineering units is not correct. The most well known instances of this attack is misrepresenting the HVEDR data sampling rates in some Caterpillar Snapshot Data [Austin 2010] and some Cummins Sudden Deceleraton Data [SEA Limited]. In these scenarios, the mitigation is to perform externally referenced testing on similar make and model ECUs to properly characterizing these behaviors. Some people may refer to these as anomalies, however, an anomaly is often not repeatable, so a better term may be more appropriate. The hexadecimal translation tool, which is being used as forensic software, has a database to map the binary network data to engineering units. Altering this database is an attack on the data as not being representative of the actual event.</div><div><br></div><div>Changing the data during transmission from the ECU to the hex translation tool usually involves transmission of the data on a vehicle network to a vehicle diagnostic adapter where the VDA will convert the message(s) into serialized data (USB or Ethernet). This PC friendly serial data is received by a device driver and served to a tool using the RP1210 API and an interprocess communication. This line of data transmission and the multiple network interfaces required to retrieve the data provide attack surfaces where the data can be altered.</div><div><br></div><div>In older J1708 networks, the data transmission is protected using an eight-bit checksum at the end of each message. This is insufficient to protect against inadvertent bit flipping caused by external noise induced in the signals. CAN, however, uses a 15-bit cyclic redundancy check to virtually guarantee the correct transmission of data over a network.</div><div><br></div><div>Once data is retrieved and stored, a file will likely exist on the forensic investigator's computer. If the ECU is put back into service and/or the data is overwritten, then the aforementioned file becomes the original source of evidence, which is subject to alteration. In some cases, an alteration is necessary. For example, a Detroit Diesel XTR file for DDEC Reports may have issues being interpreted if the date information is incorrect due to a low battery for the ECU's real time clock. Changing the bytes to affect the date in the file has a positive effect of enabling further interpretation of Hard Brake and Last Stop records by the DDEC Reports software. However, there is no mathematical method by which to verify the original authenticity of the file. This means other records could also be altered, like the recorded speed.</div><div><br></div><div>Many systems do not specify or store any original binary file and use PDF, HTML, or XML files to store these data. Some may include a checksum in the file to check tampering, but most do not. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that forensic investigators digitally sign original forensic files and obtain permission to perform any file manipulations.</div></div><div><br></div><div>SUBTREE::<br></div>",

          "content": "<div><div>The idea of data not being available&nbsp; to recover means that the HVEDR did create interesting data at one time, but the forensic recovery process was insufficient to obtain that data.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Clearly physical destruction of the memory contents is an issue when trying to recover digital data. Diesel fuel fires are particularly devastating when the ECU is consumed. The sudden loss of power during a crash is another issue regarding HVEDRs that may be beyond the control of a forensic investigator. For example, DDEC data requires a certain amount to time&nbsp; to pass after the event to finish a recording. If power is interrupted at that time, then the record does not get stored in memory. To mitigate this, the recording algorithms need to be tolerant of power loss with either reserve capacity or more rapid commitment to memory. Furthermore, the tool needs to be able to extract and interpret partial records that failed to complete due to the power loss.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>An example of recovering partial records from HVEDRs was documented in [Daily 2016] where a power loss interrupted the recording algorithm in some Caterpillar ECMs and the traditional data extraction approach failed. Another issue related to the real time clock in Detroit Diesel ECMs no longer keeps track of the correct time. The DDEC Reports software, which is used to interpret the data, cannot handle the malformed date stamps, so the Hard Brake, Last Stop, and Daily Engine Usage Logs are not presented. Forensic processes need to be robust against these types of errors and still provide other pieces of information.</div><div><br></div><div>Many HVEDRs will trigger an event from a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). These DTC codes driven events may have time history data of vehicle operation before and after events. In some cases, these DTCs can be set as a result of the crash. For example, if the physical evidence shows the engine oil pan is compromised, then a low engine oil pressure DTC may be present along with it corresponding record.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The biggest threat to these DTC based HVEDR records is having the record overwritten with a new one. This is particularly important when the electrical system on the vehicle is compromised and the device with the HVEDR functionality is removed. If that module is the engine control module, then it will expect to see many sensors and actuators connected. If those are absent when the HVEDR is turned back on, then new fault codes will be written and potentially overwrite the ones that were generated from the crash. A forensic investigator will want to know what, if any, DTCs were present at or before the crash event.</div><div><br></div><div>Mitigating overwriting fault codes can be done with logic that doesn't overwrite code freeze frame data with new data. If examining legacy systems, then transplanting the HVEDR onto a surrogate vehicle can create a fault free environment. Finally, a sensor simulation system can be used to bring ECUs back online while simulating all of the sensors and signals it is expecting, thus not setting any new fault codes.</div><div><br></div><div>Data that is not recoverable is data that should be present, but there is no easy way to obtain the information. A forensic investigator must be a good troubleshooter at times to be able to overcome power and connectivity challenges that would take an HVEDR offline after a crash. For this discussion, we will assume that things that can be fixed are fixed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Physical destruction of an HVEDR can make the data unrecoverable. Fire is the most damaging and destructive phenomenon. THe proximity of the HVEDR to fuel in some ECUs creates and environment where the hottest part of the fire will be near the HVEDR. In fact, some engine compartment ECUs use fuel to cool the electronics. Mounting the HVEDR in the cab can both reduce cost and provide better physical protections.</div><div><br></div><div>Other physical destruction of the HVEDR printed circuit board and connectors may render the HVEDR data irrecoverable through traditional means. However, some have show the ability to recover data from the memory contents of the chips themselves [Daily-2014]. Further modeling of this procedure is beyond the scope of this paper.</div><div><br></div><div>Physical destruction of the vehicle can also lead to system power loss. Experiments with Detroit Diesel and Mercedes HVEDRs show the loss of power after an event trigger prevented writing the HVEDR record to non-volatile memory. Arguably, the data was never present, but a strategy of waiting for all post-trigger data to be available makes the system less robust when dealing with events that lead to compromised electrical systems. Building an energy reserve, like a large capacitor, into the HVEDR would enable longer duration recording resulting in more robust data captures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some data is not recoverable due to the lack of proper permission. In US courts, the process of collecting evidence is scrutinized under the fourth amendment of the constitution. As such, forensic investigators should gather consent from the proper authority or obtain a search warrant from the courts. This aspect of making data not recoverable does not have a technical solution.</div></div><div><br></div><div>SUBTREE::</div>",
